# 🌾 Krishi - Hackathon Project

Hello! As part of the Smart City & Sustainability Hackathon, we built an AI-based solution aimed at helping Indian farmers.

## 🚀 How to Run This thing

### What You Need
- Python 3.8+ (I used 3.11)
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Super Easy Setup
```bash
# Just run this - it starts everything
START.bat

# Or if you want the quick setup version
QUICK_START.bat
```

That's it! The app opens at http://localhost:5173

## 🎯 What We Built

### AI Features
- **Crop Disease Detection**: Upload crop photos and get AI predictions
- **Weather Integration**: Real weather data with farming tips  
- **Smart Recommendations**: What to plant based on location and season
- **Multiple Languages**: Works in English and Hindi

### Sustainability Features
- **Carbon Footprint Tracker**: Shows CO₂ impact of farming methods
- **Sustainability Score**: Rates farming practices out of 100
- **Water Usage Tips**: Helps farmers save water
- **Organic Marketplace**: Premium pricing for organic products
- **Local First**: Prioritizes nearby farmers

### Dashboard & Analytics
- **Admin Panel**: User management and system stats
- **Analytics**: Charts showing growth and sustainability impact
- **Regional Data**: Breakdown by Indian states
- **Impact Tracking**: Farmers helped, carbon saved, etc.

### Marketplace
- **Smart Filters**: Find organic, nearby, or top-rated products
- **Sustainability Badges**: Visual eco-friendly indicators
- **Fair Pricing**: 15% premium for organic products
- **Order Tracking**: See product journey from farm to you

## 🔑 Demo Accounts

We made test accounts so you can try everything:

- **Admin**: `admin` / `password`
- **Farmer**: `farmer1` / `password`  
- **Consumer**: `consumer1` / `password`

Or just register with any email - no verification needed!

### Things to Try
1. **Farmer Journey**: Login → Upload crop photo → Check weather → List products
2. **Consumer Journey**: Browse marketplace → Filter organic → Place order
3. **Admin Journey**: View dashboard → Check sustainability metrics
4. **AI Demo**: Upload any crop image → Get disease prediction
5. **Mobile**: Open on your phone - it's responsive!
